<h1> GC-UDAP: Graph-Constraints based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Pose Estimation </h1>
 </div>
 
## 📖 Description
To extend the model to the simulated scenario of unlabeled data, we propose a keypoint prediction method based on unsupervised domain transfer.

## 🗓️ TODO
- [ Done] Prepare datasets (UDAP_Done, TigDog_Done, AP-10K_Done)
 
- [ Done] Construct the pose estimation model and pre-training 

- [ Done] Construct Skeleton-Graph Contrastive Learning model

- [ Done] Graph Constraint implementation

- [ Done] Domain Adaptation Training

- [ Done] Experiments
  
- [ Done] Revise the paper
